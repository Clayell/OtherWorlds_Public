		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_CercaniInSpaceLow = Very pleased to report that my pupils hurt a lot right now, can I stop looking at Cercani now?
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_CercaniInSpaceHigh = We uh... we are going the right way right?
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_NiennaFlyingLow = So uh, where's the surface?
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_NiennaFlyingHigh = I hope you know what you're doing.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_NiennaInSpaceLow = If this planet is a candy world, surely the surface must taste like candy right?
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_NiennaInSpaceHigh = I wonder if I could snag a taste of the rings while we're here, surely a candy world must have sugar rings right?
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C4-1SrfLanded = Pleased to report that this is still a desolate rock, I'll keep you updated.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C4-1SrfLandedCraters = Yup, looks like a crater to me.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C4-1SrfLandedMare = Pleased to report that this is still a desolate rock, I'll keep you updated.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C4-1SrfLandedHighlands = Nice job picking this high up landing site, we'll be able to save that precious fuel for the long and arduous ascent.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C4-1SrfLandedLowlands = Perhaps if we were here a few billion years earlier this place would've been more interesting, alas 'tis but a rock.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C4-1InSpaceLow = Almost reminds me of Pol... but grey.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C4-1InSpaceHigh = It would seem there is a rock nearby that wants to get our attention.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C4-2SrfLanded = We ARE landed right?
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C4-2SrfLandedLowlands = These areas seem to be covered in some sort of dark, dusty material, perhaps we've discovered a new type of seasoning?
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C4-2SrfLandedMidlands = The gravity here feels slightly stronger than Gilly.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C4-2SrfLandedNorthHighlands = We ARE landed right?
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C4-2SrfLandedSouthHighlands = We ARE landed right?
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C4-2SrfLandedNorthCrater = The impact that created this crater must've almost completely destroyed C4-2.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C4-2SrfLandedSouthCrater = The impact that created this crater must've almost completely destroyed C4-2.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C4-2SrfLandedPortBasin = This place feels a lot like Gilly.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C4-2SrfLandedWestBasin = This place feels a lot like Gilly.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C4-2SrfLandedEastBasin = This place feels a lot like Gilly.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C4-2SrfLandedCliff = This area seems unusual.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C4-2SrfLandedCraters = Did we HAVE to land directly in one of the holes??
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C4-2InSpaceLow = So many holes...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C4-2InSpaceHigh = Another fine desolate rock to add to our growing collection of desolate rocks.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_CronsSrfLanded = There seems to be an incredibly thin atmosphere here, althrough it's not enough to achieve much.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_CronsSrfLandedLowlands = The air in this area seems to be slightly denser, althrough still barely noticable.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_CronsSrfLandedMidlands = This area almost looks like it was once a seabed, I wonder if Crons' atmosphere was denser in the past...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_CronsSrfLandedHighlands = The haze looks very pretty here...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_CronsSrfLandedHighlandsEscarpments = The composition of the ground in these areas seems to differ from the majority of the planet.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_CronsSrfLandedPlateau = The ground here seems to be rather coarse and unstable.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_CronsSrfLandedMountains = This area seems to have been raised up by possible tectonic activity in Crons' icy crust.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_CronsSrfLandedApolloPeaks = Visibility is rather limited in this area, could this be where all of this dust is coming from?
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_CronsSrfLandedGeminiCraters = The material covering the floor of this crater is unusually dark.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_CronsSrfLandedMercuryCraters = The colouration of this crater is oddly reminiscent of Niko.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_CronsSrfLandedCraters = Niko's thin atmosphere doesn't do much to protect its surface it would seem, but there's still far less craters than would be expected.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_CronsSrfLandedSmallCraters = Niko's thin atmosphere doesn't do much to protect its surface it would seem, but there's still far less craters than would be expected.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_CronsSrfLandedAresDepths = There seems to be an unusual temperature spike here.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_CronsSrfLandedNorthenIceCrack = This area seems to be at a lower elevation than the rest of the planet, this is the perfect place to get readings on this planet's interior with a seismic sensor.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_CronsSrfLandedSourthenIceCrack = This area seems to be at a lower elevation than the rest of the planet, this is the perfect place to get readings on this planet's interior with a seismic sensor.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_CronsFlyingLow = The haze here makes for some stunning views, the air itself however seems to be having no appreciable effect on the vessel.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_CronsFlyingHigh = There's barely an atmosphere at all here.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_CronsInSpaceLow = Crons' terrain looks desolate, yet there is a shocking lack of impact craters across the surface.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_CronsInSpaceHigh = Crons seems to have a suprisingly large sphere of influence.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_KevariSrfLanded = At least there doesn't seem to be any lava around here...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_KevariSrfLandedCherryFields = This area seems to be covered in a thick layer of sulfur clumped up like sand, the ground doesn't feel too terribly stable...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_KevariSrfLandedCantaloupePlains = This moon looked so delicious from orbit, what happened?
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_KevariSrfLandedButterscotchHills = They really gotta stop making us want to eat these biomes...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_KevariSrfLandedTofuHeights = This area seems to be much more recent than the rest of the moon, perhaps volcanic activity still regularly occurs on Kevari?
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_KevariSrfLandedLavenderLakes = The ground here seems to be very firm and dense.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_KevariSrfLandedTaroSediment = The ground here seems unusual...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_KevariSrfLandedCraters = The impact that formed this crater seems to have punched straight through Kevari's crust, the ground is covered in a fine grainy material.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_KevariSrfLandedCalderas = Visibility in this area is rather low, the ground here also seems to be extremely hot.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_KevariSrfLandedDarkVolcanoDebris = The ground here seems to be very hot...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_KevariSrfLandedBrightVolcanoDebris = The ground here seems moderately hot...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_KevariSrfLandedOuterVolcanoDebris = The ground here is very firm and dense, and seems to be at a slightly higher temperature than the rest of the moon's surface.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_KevariInSpaceLow = The surface of this planet seems to be battered and scorched, this moon's clearly had a rough history.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_KevariInSpaceHigh = Ah great, now I fancy pizza...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_NikoSrfLanded = We seem to be landed on the surface of *Checks notes* Ike... no Niko! That's the correct name I think.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_NikoSrfLandedSurveyorMare = This area looked relatively flat from orbit... this is rather dissapointing.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_NikoSrfLandedLunokhodMare = This area looked relatively flat from orbit... this is rather dissapointing.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_NikoSrfLandedSeleneMare = This area looked relatively flat from orbit... this is rather dissapointing.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_NikoSrfLandedChangeMare = This area looked relatively flat from orbit... this is rather dissapointing.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_NikoSrfLandedMare = This area looked relatively flat from orbit... this is rather dissapointing.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_NikoSrfLandedRingedCraters = The impactor that formed this crater must've been massive.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_NikoSrfLandedRingsCliffs = We seem to be landed at the most interesting part of this dull rock.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_NikoSrfLandedHighlands = The gravity here feels slightly stronger than Ike.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_NikoSrfLandedLowlands = Hmmm... Yes... this rocky terrain looks to be comprised of rock.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_NikoSrfLandedMidlands = Honestly, this would make for an excellent place to fake an Ike landing if we ever needed to.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_NikoSrfLandedPoles = There seems to be a high concentraction of water ice in this area.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_NikoInSpaceLow = Thanks to detailed visual observation, we can finally confirm what our top scientists have suspected all along: Niko is a dull grey rock.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_NikoInSpaceHigh = What is Ike doing here?
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PequarSrfLanded = The gravity here feels fairly comfortable.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PequarSrfLandedSandMares = It seems that an ample opportunity has presented itself to build the first ever extra-terrestrial sand castle (Out of actual sand instead of Mün regolith).
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PequarSrfLandedJebsMountains = These mountains seem to be primarily comprised of basaltic rock, suggesting they were possibly formed in some sort of violent impact.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PequarSrfLandedPeaks = The ice on these peaks seems to be rather thick, suggesting that it has been here for a long time.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PequarSrfLandedLowlands = The ground here seems to be very firm, suggesting the sand here is rather compact and dense.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PequarSrfLandedMidlands = The gravity of this planet feels rather comfortable and home-like, however the cold air and the entire planet being a barren desert is a stern contrast to Kerbin.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PequarSrfLandedHighlands = The ground here seems to be very stable, owing to it being mostly rocky with little sand.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PequarSrfLandedNorthenSandLowland = Strangely enough, this area seems to be primarily sandy instead of icy, this area is also touted as offering some of the best views in the entire Cercani system.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PequarSrfLandedJebsMare = This area was once the site of a giant impact which completely reshaped Pequar's entire surface, extensive errosion shows that such impact occured a very long time ago, I wonder what this planet could've looked like beforehand...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PequarSrfLandedIcecaps = These ice caps seem to be a roughly 50/50 mixture of CO2 & H2O ice and bear a strong resemblance to Duna's, I wonder if all of this water could've been liquid back when the planet was warmer...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PequarSrfLandedValentinaMons = This seems to be the site of the most recent volcanic activity to occur on this planet, but the age of the ice covering it suggests that it has not errupted for a very long time...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PequarSrfLandedValentinaValley = This depression seems unlikely to have been caused by fluid activity, suggesting it was caused by some sort of impact or perhaps volcanic activity?
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PequarSrfLandedCraters = The age of this area and the age of JebMare seem to almost precisely line up, suggesting that they were both formed in the same impact.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PequarSrfLandedIcecaps = These ice caps seem to be a roughly 50/50 mixture of CO2 & H2O ice and bear a strong resemblance to Duna's, I wonder if all of this water could've been liquid back when the planet was warmer...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PequarSrfLandedHiddenValleys = These valleys seem to show faint signs of fluid errosion, however they are now completely dry.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PequarSrfLandedEternalStorm = Can't see anything through this storm.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PequarFlyingLow = The air here is suprisingly thin for how large this planet is, so slowing down will be challenging.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PequarFlyingHigh = The air is very thin up here, it seems most of the planet's atmosphere is compacted rather close to the surface... as with most other atmospheres now that I think about it.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PequarInSpaceLow = The rings offer up some nice views, perhaps we could stay here for a while?
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PequarInSpaceHigh = From this distance this planet bears a striking resemmblance to Duna, which is further compounded by the fact that it's being orbited by a Duna-sized moon that looks almost exactly like Duna...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C3-1SrfLanded = We seem to have made contact with the surface.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C3-1SrfLandedLowlands = From here C3-1 no longer resembles pasta.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C3-1SrfLandedHighlands = Are we landed? "Landed" seems to have a very loose definition here.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C3-1SrfLandedGiantsClimb = Better hope we don't slip off, it's a long way down from here (Not that "down" means much in this context)
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C3-1SrfLandedRidge = This ridge seems to be made up of loose material clumped up by C3-1's incredibly weak gravity from Pequar's rings.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C3-1SrfLandedRidgeCraters = This area seems to have had a large chunk of material blasted off it by an infalling moonlet.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C3-1SrfLandedCraters = These craters may have been formed from the continual bombardment of C3-1's surface by other tiny moonlets from Pequar's rings.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C3-1SrfLandedSouthernBasin = The large number of craters here seems to indicate that this was the impact site of another small moon, how this impact didn't completely destroy C3-1 is a mystery.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C3-1SrfLandedPoles = Pequar's rings look nothing short of stunning from here, this area seems to share a similar composition to standard asteroids, perhaps C3-1 isn't entirely comprised of ring material after all?
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C3-1InSpaceLow = The moon vaguely resembles a piece of pasta, whether it tastes like pasta remains to be seen.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C3-1InSpaceHigh = C3-1 seems to be struggling very hard to cling onto the craft with what little gravity it has.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_DisoleSrfLanded = In spite of the slightly omninous red sky, apparently this place has oxygen and is actually quite nice.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_DisoleSrfLandedRubyValley = I wonder what happened to cause this planet to die like this...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_DisoleSrfLandedCitrineValley = Not a hint of currently existent surface fluids of any kind.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_DisoleSrfLandedEmeraldValley = We're far too late for this place to have anything interesting going on.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_DisoleSrfLandedQuartzValleys = I wonder if this place once had life...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_DisoleSrfLandedNorthenPlains = The high levels of salt & sedimentary material on these plains, plus the abruptly lower elevation compared with the rest of Disole seems to implicate that this entire area was once one giant ocean, but it's been dried up for a very long time now...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_DisoleSrfLandedLowlands = The surrounding area seems to be high in sedimentary and rocky material, suggesting that large quantities of liquids once persisted here.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_DisoleSrfLandedMidlands = Analysis of the surrounding area seems to indicate a complete lack of sedimentary material, nor does there seem to be any indication of errosion.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_DisoleSrfLandedRiverBeds = The structure of this area plus the high levels of sedimentary material here confirms that Disole once had surface liquids, the pristine quality of this river bed may indicate that it wasn't until very recently in Disole's history that it completely dried out.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_DisoleSrfLandedEquatorialPlains = These plains seem to be covered in a layer of salt, seemingly blown here from elsewhere on the planet.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_DisoleSrfLandedDiamondPeak = This area seems to be the remains of an ancient supervolcano, perhaps this volcano was responsible for thickening Disole's atmosphere enough for it to be warm enough to support surface liquids?
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_DisoleSrfLandedSandyCliffs = This area seems to be rather unstable, with the sand that makes up the majority of the ground being very loosely bound to the cliff faces.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_DisoleSrfLandedHighlands = In spite of the slightly omninous red sky, apparently this place has oxygen and is actually quite nice.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_DisoleSrfLandedPlateau = The entire ground here appears to be comprised of rock and salt, with virtually no dust at all.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_DisoleFlyingLow = Perhaps this planet wouldn't be such a bad place to live after all...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_DisoleFlyingHigh = The air here is already much denser than Duna's.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_DisoleInSpaceLow = The entire planet's surface seems rather young and there are clear signs that surface fluids once flowed here, so what happened to them?
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_DisoleInSpaceHigh = What's Duna doing here?
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PrimaSecundaInSpaceLow = The two planets seem to be fighting hard between each other to grab our vessel here.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PrimaSecundaInSpaceHigh = Both planets seem to be caught in some sort of dance around each other that's unlike anything back home.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PrimaSrfLanded = Secunda seems to dominate the sky from here.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PrimaSrfLandedMannsHeights = This area seems to be covered in some very unusual material.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PrimaSrfLandedMountPraeteritus = The geologic structure of this area would seem to point to it being some sort of cryovolcano.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PrimaSrfLandedCraters = This crater is rather large...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PrimaSrfLandedMannsCanyon = Secunda seems to dominate the sky from here.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PrimaSrfLandedHighlands = This area seems to have a higher elevation than the rest of Prima.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PrimaSrfLandedMidlands = The ground here seems to be very solid.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PrimaSrfLandedLowlands = This place reminds me of Eeloo for some reason...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PrimaSrfLandedFabulaCalderas = This area seems to be slightly warmer than the surrounding area.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PrimaSrfLandedThinCrust = It's strangely unnerving to think about what could be underneath us right now...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PrimaInSpaceLow = Prima definitely isn't as dead as initially thought, there's a lot of interesting terrain down there.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_PrimaInSpaceHigh = Secunda really does not like us being here right now.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_SecundaSrfLanded = Prima seems to dominate the sky
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_SecundaSrfLandedHighlands = This area seems to be covered in a rather thick layer of tholins, the consistency of the ground here almost seems sand-like.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_SecundaSrfLandedMidlands = This area seems to be covered in a thin layer of tholins.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_SecundaSrfLandedLowlands = This area seems to be covered in a thin layer of tholins.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_SecundaSrfLandedStaehleRegio = This area seems interesting.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_SecundaSrfLandedStaehleRifts = Wouldn't want to fall down here that's for certain.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_SecundaSrfLandedRalphRange = Where does this mountain range end?
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_SecundaSrfLandedAliceRange = We seem to be pretty high up here...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_SecundaSrfLandedCraters = The impactor that formed this area may have in fact originated from Prima...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_SecundaSrfLandedKahuaKea = The ices that cover this part of the planet seem to have a rather unusual composition.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_SecundaSrfLandedOuterKahuaKea = There seems to be elevated tholin levels here, the ground seems to be rather unstable.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_SecundaSrfLandedPohakuRegio = The terrain here... is odd to say the least...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_SecundaSrfLandedPohakuValleys = The terrain here... is odd to say the least...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_SecundaSrfLandedPohakuCliffs = The ground here doesn't seem to have much dust covering it.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_SecundaSrfLandedPohakuHeights = This area seems to have a higher elevation than the surrounding areas.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_SecundaInSpaceLow = Very... green...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_SecundaInSpaceHigh = Nobody told me there was a mass gathering of Kerbals on the surface of Secunda!
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_TroniSrfLanded = Request permission for immediate EVA to sample the surface!
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_TroniSrfLandedLowlands = Eh, looks chocolatey enough.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_TroniSrfLandedChocolatePlains = Request permission for immediate EVA to sample the surface!
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_TroniSrfLandedCrescentCoast = This place sounds like it'd have some nice views... if we could see a thing at all.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_TroniSrfLandedMidlands = Request permission for immediate EVA to sample the surface!
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_TroniSrfLandedHighlands = This area appears brighter than the rest of the planet, white chocolate perhaps?
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_TroniSrfLandedVanillaHills = This place offers a nice contrast to the rest of the planet, shame there's no chocolate to be seen through.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_TroniSrfLandedMountains = It's a good thing all of the lava is down there and we're up here.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_TroniSrfLandedPeaks = It's a good thing all of the lava is down there and we're up here.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_TroniSrfLandedCoastline = Gettin' toasty in here, our suits are designed for this right?
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_TroniSrfLandedGehennaOcean = Oh, so it IS orange juice after all??
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_TroniSrfLandedNequeLakes = I feel like this wasn't the optimal landing site...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_TroniSrfLandedPurgaLake = We missed the island, I hope you have a plan B.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_TroniSrfLandedLavaLakes = WHY DID WE LAND HERE???
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_TroniSrfLandedHiddenLakes = This area seems to be unusually hot in spite of being on the cold side of the planet and its distance from any of the lava oceans.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_TroniSrfLandedIslands = I feel like we should've brought an electric guitar here.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_TroniSrfLandedIceCap = This area offers a stern contrast to the rest of the planet, being cold and desolate instead of hot and desolate.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_TroniSrfLandedIceCrater = Something happened here a long time ago, perhaps it could have been the cause of Troni becoming hell, I wonder what this planet looked like beforehand...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_TroniSrfLandedCliffs = Something tells me this wasn't the optimal landing site for a delicate rocket to land on, but uh we're here now I guess.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_TroniSrfLandedCraters = This planet has had a rough time huh.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_TroniInSpaceLow = You folks over at mission control wouldn't mind if I just so happened to have brought a straw to sample the "lava" would you?
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_TroniInSpaceHigh = If this planet had any moons in the past they're long gone by now.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_VassaSrfLanded = Being on this planet feels so close to being on Kerbin, yet something about it just feels... off...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_VassaSrfLandedPermafrostHighlands = This entire area seems to be raised a considerable height above the surrounding plains due to some unknown mechanism.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_VassaSrfLandedPermafrost = Did we land on the wrong side of the planet?
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_VassaSrfLandedHighlands = This area seems moderately high up, the views from up here must be nice.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_VassaSrfLandedMidlands = The winds here feel relatively weak, perfect for flying a kite.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_VassaSrfLandedLowlands = The winds here seem moderately strong, did we bring a strong enough kite?
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_VassaSrfLandedWindLowlands = We need to abort, the kite we brought isn't strong enough for these winds.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_VassaSrfLandedClarkeMare = Nevermind the kite we brought, is our craft itself strong enough for these winds?
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_VassaSrfLandedCalmCoasts = This area seems so nice and calm, perfect place to go on holiday (If you don't mind the lack of oxygen).
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_VassaSrfLandedFjords = The wind here is almost nonexistent, this area could make for a nice base.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_VassaSrfLandedThermalLakes = Thermal readings from this lake seem to suggest it is kept much warmer than the rest of the water on this planet due to some unknown mechanism.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_VassaSrfLandedHiddenLakes = It seems there's a lake here somehow, I wonder how keologically active this planet really is...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_VassaSrfLandedLakeOfStorms = Please find me the person who thought it'd be a good idea to land dead on the strongest winds on the entire planet, I just want to talk...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_VassaSrfLandedLakes = Yup, it certainly feels like we are in water.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_VassaSrfLandedEyeOfTheStorm = This area feels strangely tranquil, compared to the chaos surrounding us...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_VassaSrfLandedRockyCliffs = This area is strangely nostalgic, make sure you remind me not to take my helmet off out there...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_VassaSrfLandedArchipelagoEastCenter = These islands seem to be a small section of a large rift valley that appears to have risen above the ocean, perhaps due to high levels of keologic activity in this area?
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_VassaSrfLandedArchipelagoWestTop = These islands seem to have been here for a very, very long time, suggesting very little keologic activity in this area.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_VassaSrfLandedArchipelagoCrater = This area seems to be one giant extinct volcano, the extensive weathering and the age of the ice covering this area suggest that it has been extinct for a very long time.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_VassaSrfLandedArchipelagoWestSouth = These islands feel very calm and isolated, this place has a strange tranquil feeling in spite of the high winds.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_VassaSrfLandedArchipelagoRift = The structure of this area seems to implicate that these scattered islands form a small part of a very large undersea rift.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_VassaSrfLandedArchipelagoNorthRidge = Evidence of erosion on the higher parts of the islands seem to implicate that this area was once much lower and thus is slowly rising out of the water, perhaps this area could mark the beginnings of a new continent?
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_VassaSrfLandedIslands = Being on this planet feels so close to being on Kerbin, yet something about it just feels... off...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_VassaSrfLandedBigIslands = This island appears to be slowly shrinking as it drifts closer to the center of the sun-facing side of the planet, in a few hundred years it could melt altogether.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_VassaFlyingLow = This place feels so much like being home again, yet something just feels... off...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_VassaFlyingHigh = This planet's atmosphere seems to be slightly thicker than Kerbin's in spite of the lower gravity.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_VassaInSpaceLow = There doesn't seem to be any evidence of any sort of surface vegetation, however this doesn't rule out the possibilty of aquatic or subglacial life.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_VassaInSpaceHigh = There is no doubt now that the mysterious signal we previously detected is emanating from this planet, we must investigate this further.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C2-1SrfLanded = Yup, we are touched down on a rock.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C2-1SrfLandedLowlands = This moon doesn't seem to share many similarities to Vassa in terms of composition, perhaps it could be a captured asteroid?
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C2-1SrfLandedMidlands = This moon has a much higher surface gravity than would be expected for how small it is, indicating it may be much denser than previously thought.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C2-1SrfLandedHighlands = If it weren't for the very low gravity and how close Vassa is, I'd be convinced I were on the Mün right now.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C2-1SrfLandedCraters = These areas seem to have a composition much closer to Vassa than the rest of the moon, suggesting these craters were formed by ejecta from Vassa.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C2-1SrfLandedCliff = We'd best avoid falling here, it's a long way down.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C2-1SrfLandedGreenSediment = The material covering this area seems to be slightly radioactive, it is unlikely that this material could've been sourced from the inner Cercani system.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C2-1InSpaceLow = The radio signal is very strong from this altitude, its precise source should be fairly easy to pinpoint at this point.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_crewReport_C2-1InSpaceHigh = The craft's onboard coms equipment can just barely detect the radio signal at this point, we will need to get closer first.

		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_evaReport_C4-1SrfLandedMare = The ground here feels very porus and uneven.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_evaReport_C4-1SrfLandedHighlands = Nienna looks absolutely stunning in the sky...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_evaReport_C4-1SrfLandedLowlands = The ground here feels feels suprisingly firm and stable.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_evaReport_C4-1InSpaceLow = Orbiting so far from Nienna, this rock must surely get lonely...
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_evaReport_C4-1InSpaceHigh = C4-1 seems to be similar to Pol in terms of size and mass, but most certainly not in terms of composition.

		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_magnetometer_C4-1InSpaceLow = C4-1's crust seems to be weakly magnetized, perhaps it was once much closer to Nienna?

		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_magnetometer_CronsInSpaceLow = Crons' atmosphere seems to carry an induced charge from interactions with Nienna's magnetosphere, making it very difficult to identify whether Crons has its own intrinstic magnetosphere or not.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_magnetometer_CronsInSpaceHigh = There seems to be a relatively strong mangetic moment emanating from Crons.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_magnetometer_KevariInSpaceLow = Kevari seems to possess its own intrinsic magnetosphere independant of Nianna's, likely produced by dynamo activity within its outer core, however this magnetic field is much weaker than Nienna's or even Kerbin's.

		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_magnetometer_C3-1InSpaceLow = C3-1's entire crust seems to be magnetically charged by interactions with Pequar's magnetosphere.

		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_magnetometer_VassaInSpaceLow = In spite of the complete lack of an induced magnetic field, Vassa's crust seems to still be highly magnetized, suggesting that Vassa may have had a very powerful magnetic field up until very recently.
		#LOC_OWR_ScienceDefs_magnetometer_VassaInSpaceHigh = Suprisingly enough, there doesn't seem to be a detectable magnetic moment coming from Vassa, if it weren't for how calm Cercani is this planet would not be able to hold onto an atmosphere for very long.
